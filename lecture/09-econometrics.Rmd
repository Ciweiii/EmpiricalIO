# Review of Econometrics {#other}

## What are structural models?

- An economic model is a mapping from exogenous variables (including shocks and parameters) to endogenous variables.
- This mapping is derived by a solution concept (optimality and equilibrium).
- Structural estimation approach starts from an economic model and derives an econometric model.
